# challenge3-passwordgen

## Description
I undertook this project with the aim of enabling a webpage to generate passwords on demand. I added some arrays and a few functions to the existing code in order to implement a computational process by which the clicking of the "generate password" button would prompt the user's selection of various criteria and then deliver within the text box a randomly generated password matching those specifications. In the process of writing this code I was able to explore the fundamentals of JavaScript while practicing with functions, methods, objects, and more.

## Installation
N/A

## Usage
Click the "generate password" button and respond to a sequence of prompts. If your selected criteria fit within the given parameters, a password will appear in the text box.
